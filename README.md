# Reversi Game in Android

In this project we have done our first complex application for the subject "Apps for mobile devices" 
that we are doing in the university of Lleida.

## People that develop this app
    Nil Agut - @nilagut
    Jaume Giralt - @jaumeg3

## Description
We have done this app with a GridView of Buttons. It's possible to play with a friend in the same
device but we haven't develop a layout to configure. By default it's with AI. If you want, you can
change the boolean to activate that feature. We have develop also personalized toasts (notifications).

## TODO
For the next deliver, we want to finish to develop the layout of configuration and adapt for other 
devices with frames and also save a list of games done. Also improve the usability and the design.
